abstract = {Abstract We develop a novel seismic attenuation tomography method that is formulated under a matrix-free framework and avoids ray tracing. The key ingredient is the use of the adjoint-state technique to compute the gradient of the misfit function, defined as the difference between observed and synthetic \${t}^{\ast }\$, to obtain an optimal attenuation model. Two advancements have been achieved over previous ray-based methods. First, \${t}^{\ast }\$ is accurately computed using a grid-based method to solve the Eikonal equation, followed by solving the \${t}^{\ast }\$ governing equation. Second, the inversion mainly requires solving the forward and adjoint equations, with a cost roughly twice that of forward modeling alone. The proposed method is benchmarked by imaging the \${Q}\_{P}\$ structure of the Hikurangi subduction zone beneath northern New Zealand. The amplitude spectra of P-waves from local earthquakes are inverted to estimate \${t}^{\ast }\$ at 1 Hz, along with the seismic moment and corner frequency of each event. A total of \$65,001\ {t}^{\ast }\$ measurements from 6,478 events at 44 stations are used. The new \${Q}\_{P}\$ model shows high \${Q}\_{P}\$ in the subducted, cold Pacific plate, adjacent to the low \${Q}\_{P}\$ mantle wedge, matching previous results. Our findings reveal contrasting high and low \${Q}\_{P}\$, at depths of \${\sim} 60-100\$ km beneath the backarc, may indicating the presence of a lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The low \${Q}\_{P}\$ beneath the backarc originates from depths of \${\sim} \$150–200 km to the LAB, ascending along a nonvertical path toward the region beneath the arc, which may result from the dehydration of the deeply subducted slab.},
