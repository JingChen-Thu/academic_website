abstract = {Abstract On 7 January 2025, a Mw 7.1 normal-faulting earthquake occurred in the Dinggye Rift zone, southern Tibetan plateau. In this study, we present high-resolution crustal S-wave isotropic and P-wave azimuthally anisotropic velocity models around the source region of this earthquake, constructed using novel adjoint-state traveltime tomography techniques. We find that the high-slip zone of the mainshock rupture coincides with a high-strength asperity (Lhagai gneiss dome) characterized by negligible seismic anisotropy. The source region is subject to basal shear imposed by the underthrusting Indian slab and impinging fluid flow through a slab window, as evidenced by the observations of convergence-parallel anisotropy and pronounced low-velocity anomalies below the hypocenter. These tectonic forces collectively reconfigure the local stress field to favor normal faulting by counteracting the convergence-induced compression, and together with the high elastic strain accumulation facilitated by the fault asperity, contributes to the generation of this high-magnitude normal-faulting continental earthquake.},
