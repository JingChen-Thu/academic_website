    abstract = "{In this study, we present high‐resolution seismic velocity models for the Los Angeles basin (LAB) and its adjacent area using adjoint‐state travel‐time tomography, fitting an extensive database of P‐ and S‐wave travel times accumulated from 1980 to 2021. We select 151,193 first P‐wave travel times and 149,997 first S‐wave travel times from local earthquakes archived in the Southern California Earthquake Data Center to determine the velocity models, with earthquake locations updated at each iteration. With seismic stations spaced more than 3.5 km apart, our dataset has limited resolution in the uppermost 1–2 km. However, starting from three different initial models, our VP models, which are optimally imaged between 3 and 15 km, show similar velocity heterogeneity and provide a better fit to the observed first travel‐time data compared to the Community Velocity Model‐Harvard 15.1.0 and Community Velocity Model‐Southern California Earthquake Center 4.26. Our models provide a detailed delineation of the subsurface structure beneath the LAB, revealing significant velocity variations across active faults, a 10‐km‐thick sequence of sedimentary rocks within the basin, and a distinct basin margin marked by transitions from low to high‐velocities. In addition, these models highlight basement structures with elevated VP and VS located at depths of 9 to 12 km and beyond. Specifically, beneath the northeastern part of the basin, the models demonstrate improved accuracy and reliability in reflecting the linear relationship between VP and VS in mafic rocks. The accurate delineation of the basin’s structure provided by our models could also offer robust constraints for seismic response modeling and seismic hazard assessment in the region.}",
