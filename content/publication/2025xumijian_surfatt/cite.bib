    abstract = {SurfATT is a novel software package designed for ambient noise surface‐wave tomography. It employs the innovative adjoint‐state travel‐time tomography method with the consideration of model inhomogeneity and surface topography. Key features of SurfATT include a user‐friendly interface, efficient memory utilization, and high computational performance. As a result, it capably handles surface‐wave tomography for large‐scale datasets and models. Benchmark tests further highlight SurfATT’s remarkable performance, particularly on high‐performance computing systems and Apple M1 Max chip, underscoring its potential compatibility across diverse computing environments. Its application to the western U.S. region showcases its effectiveness in generating high‐resolution tomographic images and revealing spatial correlations with tectonic features. Overall, SurfATT emerges as an efficient solution for surface‐wave tomography tasks, offering researchers and practitioners a powerful tool for understanding Earth’s subsurface structures.},
